# Responsive Layout
CSS to create responsive layout using @media (without using any JavaScript).  For wider screen size page layout is two columns side-by-side. But for smaller screen size when width of viewport is below 600px, automatically changes to stacked layout.

The focus here is on CSS using @media to create responsive layout.  Hence example shows simple web page with div sections for two-column layout. Note that additional styles are included in example html file, but that does not impact the responsive layout feature.
